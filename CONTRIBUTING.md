# Contributing to GoShort

Thank you for showing your interest in contributing to GoShort! From commenting on and triaging issues, to reviewing and sending Pull Requests, all contributions are welcome.

This document covers everything you need to know about contributing to GoShort. Before you get started, please make sure you read all of the sections and are able to sign our CLA.

## Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

Contributions to this project must be accompanied by a Contributor License Agreement. You (or your employer) retain the copyright to your contribution; this simply gives us permission to use and redistribute your contributions as part of the project. Head over to [CLA](https://opensource.powflix.com/cla) to see your current agreements on file or to sign a new one.

You generally only need to submit a CLA once, so if you've already submitted one (even if it was for a different project), you probably don't need to do it again.

## Code of conduct

Powflix has adopted "Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct V2.0", participants are expected to follow the guildlines described in [CODE_OF_CONDUCT](https://github.com/powflix/goshort/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)

## Code reviews

Before starting work on a change, comment on one of the open issues saying you'd like to take it on. If one does not exist, you can also create one here.

Be sure to reference this issue number in your pull request (e.g., "Fix truncated text values #27"), and preferably in your commit message.

All submissions, including submissions by project members, require review. We use GitHub pull requests for this purpose. Consult [GITHUB HELP](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) for more information on using pull requests.

There are other ways you can contribute without writing a single line of code. Here are a few things you can do to help out:

* **Replying and handling open issues:** You can help in every day issues, that lack necessary information. You can help out by guiding people through the process of filling out the issue template, asking for clarifying information, or pointing them to existing issues that match their description of the problem. We cover more about this process in the Issue Triage wiki.

* **Reviewing pull requests for the docs:** Reviewing documentation updates can be as simple as checking for spelling and grammar. If you encounter situations that can be explained better in the docs, click Edit at the top of most docs pages to get started with your own contribution.

* **Help people write test plans:** Some pull requests sent to the main repository may lack a proper test plan. These help reviewers understand how the change was tested, and can speed up the time it takes for a contribution to be accepted.

Each of these tasks is highly impactful, and maintainers will greatly appreciate your help.

## Contributing Code

Code-level contributions to GoShort generally come in the form of pull requests. These are done by forking the repo and making changes locally. The process of proposing a change to GoShort can be summarized as follows:

* Fork the GoShort repository and create your branch from `master`.
* Make the desired changes to GoShort sources and perform tests.
* If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
* Ensure the test suite passes, either locally or on CI once you opened a pull request.
* Push the changes to your fork.
* Create a pull request to the GoShort repository.
* Review and address comments on your pull request.
    * A bot may comment with suggestions. Generally we ask you to resolve these first before a maintainer will review your code.
* If you haven't signed "Contributor License Agreement (CLA)" already, please complete it here: [CLA]()

**Note:** You must sign a Contribution License Agreement (CLA) before your pull request can be merged. This a one-time requirement for Powflix projects on GitHub. You can read more about "Contributor License Agreements (CLA)" on [WIKIPEDIA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contributor_License_Agreement). When your pull request is created, it is classified by the Powflix GitHub bot. If you have not signed a CLA, the bot will provide instructions for signing a [CLA]() before your pull request can be considered eligible for merging. Once you have done so, the current and all future pull requests will be labelled as "CLA Signed"

If all goes well, your pull request will be merged. If it is not merged, maintainers will do their best to explain the reason why.
